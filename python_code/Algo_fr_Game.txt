Possible Clues:
#     Close: You've guessed a correct number but in the wrong position
#     Match: You've guessed a correct number in the correct position
#     Nope: You haven't guess any of the numbers correctly



Step 1: Generate 3 digit CODE (no repition)
  use range(10)
  convert the element of range to string and store as list
  shuffle list
  save only 3 digit of list as generated CODE

Step 2: Get digits from user
  store userGuess in a list
  Compare userGuess and code
  if matches, return "code cracked"
  if not, generate clue_status.
    enumerate through userGuess
    check if the digit in userGuess matches with digit in CODE along with index location
       add match in clue_status
    else check if digit in userGuess matches with digit in CODE without index locaiton
       add close in clue_status
    else if nothing matches
       add none in clue_status
  print clue_status

Step 3: Repeat step 2 till you crack the code
